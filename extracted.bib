  abstract =      {The Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) has been
                   used by astronomers for over 30 years as a data
                   interchange and archiving format; FITS files are now
                   handled by a wide range of astronomical software
                   packages. Since the FITS format definition document
                   (the ``standard'') was last printed in this journal
                   in 2001, several new features have been developed and
                   standardized, notably support for 64-bit integers in
                   images and tables, variable-length arrays in tables,
                   and new world coordinate system conventions which
                   provide a mapping from an element in a data array to
                   a physical coordinate on the sky or within a
                   spectrum. The FITS Working Group of the International
                   Astronomical Union has therefore produced this new
                   version 3.0 of the FITS standard, which is provided
                   here in its entirety. In addition to describing the
                   new features in FITS, numerous editorial changes were
                   made to the previous version to clarify and
                   reorganize many of the sections. Also included are
                   some appendices which are not formally part of the
                   standard. The FITS standard is likely to undergo
                   further evolution, in which case the latest version
                   may be found on the FITS Support Office Web site at

                   data model, library, and file format for storing and
                   managing data. It is designed for flexible and
                   efficient I/O and for high volume, complex data. The
                   Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) project is solving the
                   challenge of data size and complexity using HDF5.
                   Most of LOFAR's standard data products will be stored
                   using HDF5; the beam-formed time-series data and
                   transient buffer board data have already transitioned
                   from project-specific binary format to HDF5. We
                   report on our effort to pave the way towards new
                   astronomical data encapsulation using HDF5, which can
                   be used by future ground and space projects. The
                   LOFAR project has formed a collaboration with NRAO,
                   the Virtual Astronomical Observatory (VAO) and the
                   HDF Group to obtain funding for a full-time staff
                   member to work on documenting and developing
                   standards for astronomical data written in HDF5. We
                   hope our effort will enhance HDF5 visibility and
                   usage within the community, specifically for LSST,
                   the SKA pathfinders (ASKAP, MeerKAT, MWA, LWA), and
                   other major new radio telescopes such as EVLA, ALMA,

                   implementation of the affine-invariant ensemble
                   sampler for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) proposed
                   by Goodman & Weare (2010). The code is open source
                   and has already been used in several published
                   projects in the astrophysics literature. The
                   algorithm behind emcee has several advantages over
                   traditional MCMC sampling methods and it has
                   excellent performance as measured by the
                   autocorrelation time (or function calls per
                   independent sample). One major advantage of the
                   algorithm is that it requires hand-tuning of only 1
                   or 2 parameters compared to ~N2 for a traditional
                   algorithm in an N-dimensional parameter space. In
                   this document, we describe the algorithm and the
                   details of our implementation. Exploiting the
                   parallelism of the ensemble method, emcee permits any
                   user to take advantage of multiple CPU cores without

  year =          {2010},
  abstract =      {Reduced chi-squared is a very popular method for
                   model assessment, model comparison, convergence
                   diagnostic, and error estimation in astronomy. In
                   this manuscript, we discuss the pitfalls involved in
                   using reduced chi-squared. There are two independent
                   problems: (a) The number of degrees of freedom can
                   only be estimated for linear models. Concerning
                   nonlinear models, the number of degrees of freedom is
                   unknown, i.e., it is not possible to compute the
                   value of reduced chi-squared. (b) Due to random noise
                   in the data, also the value of reduced chi-squared
                   itself is subject to noise, i.e., the value is
                   uncertain. This uncertainty impairs the usefulness of
                   reduced chi-squared for differentiating between
                   models or assessing convergence of a minimisation
                   procedure. The impact of noise on the value of
                   reduced chi-squared is surprisingly large, in
                   particular for small data sets, which are very common
                   in astrophysical problems. We conclude that reduced
                   chi-squared can only be used with due caution for
                   linear models, whereas it must not be used for
                   nonlinear models at all. Finally, we recommend more
                   sophisticated and reliable methods, which are also
                   applicable to nonlinear models.},

                   analysis. Whenever a parameter is estimated

                   Any parameter estimate that is given without an error
                   estimate is meaningless. Nevertheless, many
                   (undergraduate or graduate) students have to teach
                   such methods for error estimation to themselves when
                   working scientifically for the first time. This
                   manuscript presents an easy-to-understand overview of
                   different methods for error estimation that are
                   applicable to both model-based and model-independent
                   parameter estimates. These methods are not discussed
                   in detail, but their basics are briefly outlined and
                   their assumptions carefully noted. In particular, the
                   methods for error estimation discussed are grid
                   search, varying $\chi^2$, the Fisher matrix,
                   Monte-Carlo methods, error propagation, data
                   resampling, and bootstrapping. Finally, a method is
                   outlined how to propagate measurement errors through
                   complex data-reduction pipelines.},
